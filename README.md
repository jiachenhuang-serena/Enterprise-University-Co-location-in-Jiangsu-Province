# Enterprise-University-Co-location-in-Jiangsu-Province
Project Purpose:

This project aims to explore and analyze the spatial co-location relationship between high-tech enterprises and universities in Jiangsu Province, with the goal of revealing the spatial interdependence and innovation spillover effects between enterprises and universities. The analysis is based on topological data analysis (using the TopoTest method), distance-based spatial statistical methods (such as the M function and Kd function), and regression analysis, providing an in-depth understanding of the co-location phenomenon between enterprises and universities, and helping to optimize regional innovation resource allocation and policy formulation.

Project Features:

-Data: This project provides geographic data for over 400 universities and more than 50,000 high-tech enterprises in Jiangsu Province.

-Topological Data Analysis: Using the TopoTest method and Euler Characteristic Curve (ECC), this project conducts topological testing of the spatial distribution of enterprises and universities across the province, analyzing their spatial differences and co-location relationships at different scales.

-Spatial Statistical Methods: The project employs distance-based methods such as the M function and Kd function to quantitatively analyze the spatial relationship and proximity between enterprises and universities at various distance ranges.

-Regression Analysis: Using a multilevel regression model, the project examines the key factors influencing enterprise-university co-location, including enterprise characteristics, university types, and regional differences, while considering the effects of regional fixed effects.

-Visualization and Results Presentation: The project generates various spatial distribution and topological analysis plots, clearly illustrating the spatial relationships between enterprises and universities in different cities of Jiangsu Province, aiding in the intuitive understanding of co-location patterns.
